# Employee Retention Analysis

## About This Project
I worked on an HR dataset to find out why employees were leaving a company. I used Excel to explore the data and created pivot tables and charts to show trends like which departments had the most resignations, and how factors like education and years of experience affected attrition.

## What I Used
- Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Conditional Formatting

## What I Found
- Some departments had much higher attrition than others.
- People with more than 3 years of experience were more likely to leave.
- Gender and education also had some influence on attrition.
